# todo-SPA

My todo single-page application is modeled off the todo SPA project from [The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on Udemy. The app includes a public API accessible at `/api/todos` and `/api/todos/:todoID` where `:todoID` is the ID of a given todo. As this is intended solely as a learning project the api and app are **UNSECURED** and therefore **extreme caution should be taken before deploying publicly!**

That being said, a live version of the app can temporarily be found [here](https://morning-peak-27497.herokuapp.com/).
